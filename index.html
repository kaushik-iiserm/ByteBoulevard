                "My name is Kaushik Gupta and I am a 4th year Master Student majoring in Physics  at IISER Mohali. My research interests lies
                 at the intersection of Particle Physics and Astronomy. I have a profound interest in understanding the characteristics of Dark Matter 
                 present in our Universe.  Accurate quantification of the dark matter perturbations would also have a far reaching consequences for big bang cosmology.
                 I became interested in this area while doing a project under Dr. Vishal Bhadrwaj, where I did analyse the LHCâ€™s data on Particle 
                 classification with deep learning to improve real-time event in Elementary Physics. I worked remotely in designing Neural networks
                  model for the seperation of Uds, Charm and Signal in Jets. After this project, I have had the opportunity to work with Dr Brijesh Kumar
                   and study the light curve characteristics of Type 1A Supernova. In addition to my research, I have also been actively involved in a 
                  number of outreach and teaching initiatives, including  organizing coding workshops or events for undergraduate enthuasist. I also have a interest 
                  reading cognitive pshycology and liberal sociology. Looking to the future, I hope to continue building upon my research and make meaningful contributions to the field of Particle physics.
                 Overall, I am excited to see where my passion for research takes me and am committed to making a positive impact through my work."
